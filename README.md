## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, with an emphasis on C programming.

## Usage

Download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cwalk/ComputerScience1`

Navigate into the project directory: `cd ComputerScience1/`

There are a total of 5 programs written in C. Each comes with an input test file, and an output file of what the results should be. More information can be found in each program's respective pdf.

To run a program, make sure you have the input file inside the same directory as the C file. Make sure the input file is changed from file.in.txt to just file.in, as per the program pdf's instructions.

To compile the C file, try: `$ gcc -o [Executable File Name] [File Name].c`

To execute: `$ ./[Executable File Name]`

##Example

`$ gcc Knightsball.c -o Knightsball`

`$ ./Knightsball`
